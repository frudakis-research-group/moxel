</h4>

MOXÎµÎ» is a Python package for **parallel calculation of energy voxels**, with
emphasis on reticular chemistry.

The majority of time in a ML workflow goes into constructing the inputs and
making sure they are clean, rather than focusing on the ML part itself.

MOXÎµÎ» aims to provide a **simple and fast interface to generate energy voxels in
a ML-ready format**, minimizing as much as possible the time spent on these
preprocessing steps.
